# dum-dom v0

> _dum-dom... is giving me his cache_ - Krule, 2017

**This repository is still way deep in development. Anything and everything is liable to change depending on my wants and whims.**

## Features

- **No Reactivity:** All these frameworks trying to worm their grubby little bloated fingers into my sweet, sweet code... Back off.
- **Element Managers:** Want to display an array of data? Done. Want to change scenes in a customizable and transparent way? Sorted. Want to move a bunch of elements with various transforms between parents? Bish, bash, bosh.
- **Bespoke Elements:** Troublesome variables triggering reactivity too often? Setups required for tightly-interactive `input` elements getting you down? Overbearing frameworks forcing you to make **bad code** because they want to hold your hand like a clingy middle-school boyfriend? Fear not, because now that responsiblity is on _your_ shoulders!
- **Adaptive Single Page Routing:** Whether you're working on a offline `file://` served app or a sprawling Taj Mahal-esq website, relax and unwind with our snappy routing provider and complete control over your content.

# Installation

get lucky :)

# Usage

**Note:** Code is split, so import from closer-to-the-source to reduce irrelevant code.
For example, `import * as MasterManager from 'dum-dom/managers/MasterManager'` is better than `import { MasterManager } from 'dum-dom'` as the `dum-dom` endpoint references _everything_.
